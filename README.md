# JobMatch

This project is an attempt to provide personalized career path and job search advice to jobseekers, starting in Norway!

With this project, we aim at using information from `NAV` and other Norwegian job agencies like `finn.no` to reproduce the project [`BobEmploi`](https://github.com/bayesimpact/bob-emploi/blob/master/README.md) in Norway. 

[`BobEmploi`](https://github.com/bayesimpact/bob-emploi/blob/master/README.md) is an application that uses algorithms to provide personalized advice to jobseekers: not just recommendations for their job search, but a personalized diagnostic on the job market in their domain, on their own profile, on the tools they could use or improve in order to increase the chances of success.

## What Are We Doing?

This project hasn't started yet, but preliminary work would include:

* **BobEmploi**: Following and understanding the work done by Bayes Impact on [`BobEmploi`](https://github.com/bayesimpact/bob-emploi/blob/master/README.md).

* **Data Collection**: Looking for similar data used in `BobEmploi`, most probably coordinating with [`NAV`](https://www.nav.no/no/Person/Arbeid/Arbeidsledig+og+jobbsoker) and ['finn.no'](https://www.finn.no/job/browse.html).

See [the original project idea](https://github.com/DataForGood-Norway/project-ideas/issues/2) for the initial discussion.


## Goal

Helping jobseekers during their search by providing personalized advise with the goal of reducing unemployment and enhancing job matching.
