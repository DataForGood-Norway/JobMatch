# JobMatch

An attempt to provide personalized career and job search advice to jobseekers in Norway.

With this project, we aim at using information from NAV and finn.no to reproduce the project `BobEmploi` in Norway. 

[`BobEmploi`](https://github.com/bayesimpact/bob-emploi/blob/master/README.md) is an application that uses algorithms to provide personalized advice to jobseekers, not just recommendations for their job search.
